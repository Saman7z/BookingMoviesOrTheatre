# **BookingMoviesOrTheatre App** 

![Home screen](./ss.png)
  
  ## In this fun project I **only used** :
   - HTML
   - CSS  => no framework or library
   - Lovely Vanilla JS => 
   - The data entered will persist to the localStorage and You can Clear it as well
 
It's a **Simple Booking App** with visual seats that you can take and **it's Fun** !
